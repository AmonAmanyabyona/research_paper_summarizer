1.virtual environment
python -m venv venv

2.Activate it 
source venv/bin/activate


3.Install packages
pip install langchain-community
pip install azure-ai-inference
pip install langchain chromadb sentence-transformers pandas python-dotenv
pip install -U langchain-huggingface
pip install -U langchain-chroma
pip install pypdf
pip install torch #it is required by sentence-transformers

4. Reusable Modules

config.py → Store environment variables like API keys.

pdf_loader.py → Handles PDF loading and text extraction.

embedding.py → Handles embedding model initialization.

vectorstore.py → Manages ChromaDB vector storage.

retriever.py → Handles retrieval operations.

chat_complettion.py→ To generate responses based on input prompts..

new_app.py → Runs the main script  having added rag pipeline.

formatter.py → Handles document formatting.

prompt_template.py → Manages structured prompts.

rag_pipeline.py → Implements full retrieval and response generation.

response_processing.py → Cleans, parses, and organizes responses into DataFrames.

new_second_app.py → Runs everything end-to-end.


Delete the existing vectorstore folder
rm -rf vectorstore_test


now add UI
pip install streamlit

the final script to run and see all the processes fall into place is:
streamlit_app.py -> run it using:  streamlit run final_versionUI.py




Note about the error in terminal below

RuntimeError: no running event loop"
It happens when async functions are used where asyncio isn't properly managed. 
Since Streamlit doesn't use async execution by default, 
some libraries (especially ones like torch or langchain) might cause conflicts.
